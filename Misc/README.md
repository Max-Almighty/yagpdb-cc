## Echo
A re-creation of the echo command from carl-bot. The syntax of this command is `-echo #channel message` to echo the message to another channel, and `-echo message` to echo it into the same channel.
This command has 2 optional flags. The `-embed` flag sends the echoed message as an embed and the `-showuser` flags sends the message and shows which user was it that echoed
